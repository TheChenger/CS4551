Multimedia Information and Processing


The first project we were tasked with in this class was to implement image processing techniques,

We were given the MImage class to use to read and write data to and from PPM files.

The image that was hardcoded was the Ducky.ppm file all image processing techniques were used on.

1st: Converting a 24-bit Color Image to an 8-bit Gray-scale image

2nd: Once the 8-bit image is obtained we needed to use the Ordered Ditehring technique to generate a binary image

3rd: Quantize the input 24-bit color pixels to 8-bit color pixels using the Uniform Color Quantization method
  
    -Generated and displayed an 8-bit color Look Up Table(LUT)
    
    -Converted the input 24-bit pixels to 8-bit indexed values and saced them into the PPM format
    
    -Saved the quantized RGB pixels in PPM format
